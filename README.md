## Prerequisites
#### Search engine ID
  
  By calling the API user issues requests against an existing instance of a Custom Search Engine. Therefore, before using the API, you need to create one in the Control Panel. Follow the tutorial to learn more about different configuration options. You can find the engine's ID in the Setup > Basics > Details section of the Control Panel.
  
#### API Key
  
  JSON/Atom Custom Search API requires the use of an API key.
  
  * Custom Search Engine (free edition) users can obtain the key from the Google Developers Console.
  * Google Site Search (paid edition) users can find their API key in the Control Panel in Business > XML & JSON tab.
